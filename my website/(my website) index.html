    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
    <p id="p1">I love working with computers and I love to code it's always been fun learning more about technology. I find it to be very intriguing learning technology I love being on my pc learning new things such as AI,gaming engine sowftare and web development.I really love to learn and that's why I have decided to become a sowftare engineer. I know it's gonna be challenging but with my work ethic I know I'll accomplish my dream even though for me to get into the University I want to apply to, it might fail becuase I know my marks will not compete or will not help me much compared to other's which could be from 200 to 1000 or even more people in south africa. But I know that no matter what University or college I go to I will accomplish my dream</p>
